# Who am I?
I'm Geri and I study Java programming 👩‍💻 at @SoftUni.

I've been interested in programming for a long time, but I chose Java because my favourite game - Minecraft - is written in it 🎮!

I'm currently working hard to master Java, but aside from that I dabble in video editing 🎥, image editing and photography 📸, playing the piano 🎹 and the guitar 🎸, and horse riding 🐴.

My main goal is to help other people through my skills and knowledge ✨. I regularly update my Pastebin page so other students at @SoftUni can benefit from my solutions.
